    <h2>External Envelope Design</h2><br>
    <p>
      The external envelope of Kelham Rise is designed to meet performance, safety, and environmental standards for a high-rise, mixed-use building. The envelope includes walls, roofing, glazing, and insulation systems that work together to create a well-sealed, energy-efficient structure.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Wall System Design</h3><br>
    <p>
      We propose a prefabricated insulated panel system (e.g., SFS or SIPs) with rainscreen cladding mounted over ventilated cavities. This system offers excellent airtightness and thermal performance while allowing faster on-site installation using panelized façades.

    <br><br><h3>Glazing & Openings</h3><br>
    <p>
      The building will feature triple-glazed, aluminium-framed windows with low-e coating and argon gas filling, ensuring high thermal insulation. Solar shading fins or brise-soleil will be installed on the south and west elevations to control solar gain.
    </p><br>

   <br><br> <h3>Roof Design (Green Roof)</h3><br>
    <p>
      The flat roof will include a semi-intensive green roof system with a waterproof membrane, vapour barrier, and root barrier. The lightweight growing medium will support sedum planting, which contributes to reducing stormwater runoff and urban heat island effect.

    <br> <br> <h3>Envelope Performance Targets</h3><br>
    <p>
      This external envelope system combines high performance and buildability. Its prefabricated approach shortens site time while achieving thermal, acoustic, and weatherproofing standards. It sets the foundation for integrating smart, low-carbon innovations throughout the building.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Innovation</h2><br>
    <p>
      Innovation is central to the Kelham Rise vision. We aim to deliver a smarter, faster, greener building by applying modern construction methods and sustainable technologies. This includes prefabricated and modular systems, renewable energy features, and intelligent detailing.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Prefabricated & Modular Systems</h3><br>
    <p>
      Panelized facades, unitized window-wall systems, and pre-fabricated roof modules will speed up installation, improve safety with fewer on-site workers, and enhance quality with factory precision.
    </p><br>

    <br><br><h3>Renewable and Sustainable Features</h3><br>
    <p>
      The building will incorporate renewable energy systems, including solar panels and smart building technologies. The design will reduce reliance on grid electricity and support BREEAM certification with a target for "Excellent" rating through smart planning.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Construction Innovation</h3><br>
    <p>
      Digital BIM coordination will optimize envelope, structure, and services integration. Off-site fabrication and just-in-time delivery will ensure efficiency and minimize waste. On-site monitoring apps will facilitate snagging and quality assurance.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Resilience and Long-Term Benefits</h3><br>
    <p>
      The building will be designed for climate adaptation, reducing cooling loads and flood risks. Low-maintenance materials will reduce operating costs, ensuring the building's long-term performance.
